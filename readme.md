# Rumour Spreading Simulator
This rumour spreading simulator was written as an exercise in computational biology, in which I simulate cellular automata passing a rumour. The simulation code and executable file will allow you by default to set several parameters, a visualisation style and then run the simulation, seeing the spread on a matrix alongside percentage of living cells. More details can be found in the report, documentation or by running the Simulation GUI and pressing the information button.

The main function contains commented code for generating spread rate graphs for different distributions and L values, as well as statistical data for the strategy simulation.

## Dependencies
The simulation GUI executable file does not require anything to be installed, but to run the code you need to have the following python packages:
numpy
matplotlib
PySimpleGUI
scipy

## Running the Code
If you wish to manually run the code, simply run the main.py page and it will start the GUI. As stated above, the main block contains additional functions that you can run by uncommenting them.
